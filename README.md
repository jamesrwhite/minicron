Where possible I'm trying to follow [GitHub's Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby "GitHub's Ruby Styleguide")

Contributing
------------

I'm building minicron as a part of my final year project at University and as such cannot currently accept pull requests. Once the project is finished however (June 2014) this will most likely change.
