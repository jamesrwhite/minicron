*work in progress*

Code Style
----------

Where possible I'm trying to follow [GitHub's Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby "GitHub's Ruby Styleguide")

Requirements
-------------

- Ruby
  - 1.9.2 and above (tested on 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.0 and HEAD)
  - I haven't tested jruby or other ruby implementations *yet*
- OS
  - *Should* run on any linux/bsd based OS that the above ruby versions run on. No windows support.

Contributing
------------

I'm building minicron as a part of my final year project at University and as such cannot currently accept pull requests. Once the project is finished however (June 2014) this will most likely change.
