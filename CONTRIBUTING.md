Pull requests of all sizes are very much appreciated, below is a quick guide on how you can help:

1. Fork the master branch of this repository

2. Install a local copy of minicron like so:

````
bundle
rake install
````

3. Run the tests to be sure everything is working before you begin

````
rake spec

4. Make your changes.

5. With the exception of documentation changes require accompanying tests for them to be accepted ideally so please add some.

6. Submit your pull request!

As stated in the README minicron tries to adhere to the [Ruby Community Styleguide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide "Ruby Community Styleguide") so please try to do so when making your changes.
